# Drill Training Form Implementation Plans

The original monolithic plan has been broken down into focused, digestible modules.

## Quick Start

**New to this project?** Start with `00-overview.md` to understand the big picture.

**Ready to implement?** Follow the modules in order (01 â†’ 02 â†’ 03 â†’ 04 â†’ 05 â†’ 06).

## Module Overview

### 00-overview.md

**What it is**: High-level project context, architecture decisions, and success criteria
**Read this**: Before starting implementation
**Time**: 5 minutes

### 01-controller-refactoring.md

**What it is**: Backend controller changes (DrillsController, DrillCluesController, routes)
**Implement this**: First (easiest to test independently)
**Time**: 2-3 hours

### 02-form-views.md

**What it is**: Frontend form, Turbo Frames, views, and Turbo Streams
**Implement this**: Third (after controllers and models)
**Time**: 3-4 hours
**Bonus**: Detailed explanation of `form_with` gotchas!

### 03-stimulus-fixes.md

**What it is**: JavaScript timer controller bug fixes
**Implement this**: Fourth
**Time**: 1-2 hours

### 04-model-updates.md

**What it is**: DrillClue model validation and matching logic improvements
**Implement this**: Second (critical bugs need fixing first)
**Time**: 1 hour

### 05-testing.md

**What it is**: Comprehensive testing strategy (controller, model, system tests)
**Implement this**: Fifth (or write tests as you go)
**Time**: 3-4 hours

### 06-polish.md

**What it is**: Optional UX enhancements (animations, keyboard shortcuts, accessibility)
**Implement this**: Last (after MVP works)
**Time**: 2-3 hours

### 99-reference.md

**What it is**: Risk assessment, file summary, estimates, debugging tips
**Use this**: Throughout implementation as a reference
**Time**: Reference material

## Recommended Implementation Order

```
01. Read 00-overview.md (understand the big picture)
02. Implement 01-controller-refactoring.md
03. Implement 04-model-updates.md (fixes critical bugs)
04. Implement 02-form-views.md
05. Implement 03-stimulus-fixes.md
06. Implement 05-testing.md (or write tests as you go)
07. Implement 06-polish.md (optional enhancements)
```

**Total MVP Time**: 10-14 hours
**Total with Polish**: 12-17 hours

## What Changed from Original Plan?

The original `drill-clue-form.md` (now `drill-clue-form.original.md`) was 1000+ lines covering everything from soup to nuts. It was overwhelming!

### New Structure Benefits

- **Focused**: Each module tackles one area (controllers, views, models, etc.)
- **Actionable**: Clear steps with code examples
- **Flexible**: Implement in order or jump to what you need
- **Testable**: Each module has its own testing checklist
- **Skimmable**: Quick summaries at the top of each file
